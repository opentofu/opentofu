Note: Objects have changed outside of OpenTofu

OpenTofu detected the following changes made outside of OpenTofu since the
last "tofu apply" which may have affected this plan:

  # tfcoremock_simple_resource.base_after has changed
  # (moved from tfcoremock_simple_resource.base_before)
  ~ resource "tfcoremock_simple_resource" "base_after" {
        id     = "e450ef2f-b80f-0cce-8bdb-14d88f48649c"
      ~ string = "Hello, world!" -> "Hello, drift!"
    }


Unless you have made equivalent changes to your configuration, or ignored the
relevant attributes using ignore_changes, the following plan may include
actions to undo or respond to these changes.

OpenTofu used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place (current -> planned)

OpenTofu will perform the following actions:

  # tfcoremock_simple_resource.base_after will be updated in-place
  # (moved from tfcoremock_simple_resource.base_before)
  ~ resource "tfcoremock_simple_resource" "base_after" {
        id     = "e450ef2f-b80f-0cce-8bdb-14d88f48649c"
      ~ string = "Hello, drift!" -> "Hello, change!"
    }

  # tfcoremock_simple_resource.dependent will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "tfcoremock_simple_resource" "dependent" {
        id     = "2ecc718c-8d04-5774-5c36-7d69bf77d34e"
      ~ string = "Hello, world!" -> "Hello, change!"
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 2 to change, 0 to destroy.

Saved the plan to: equivalence_test_plan

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    tofu apply "equivalence_test_plan"
