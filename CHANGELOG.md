## 1.11.0 (Unreleased)

UPGRADE NOTES:

* OpenTofu on macOS now requires macOS 12 Monterey or later.
* The `issensitive` function previously incorrectly returned known results when given unknown values, which has now been corrected to avoid confusing consistency check failures during the apply phase, as reported in [issue #2415](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/2415).

    If your module was previously assigning something derived from an `issensitive` result to a context where unknown values are not allowed during the planning phase, such as `count`/`for_each` arguments for resources or modules, this will now fail during the planning phase and so you will need to choose a new approach where either the `issensitive` argument is always known during the planning phase or where the sensitivity of an unknown value is not used as part of the decision.
* Testing mocks previously only followed a subset of the rules defined in provider schemas. The provider schema now drives the mocking to ensure the schema is correctly followed. ([#3069](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3069))

    In rare cases this change might result in some previously-passing tests now failing, due to invalid mocks or overrides that were not detected in earlier versions.
* OpenTofu no longer accepts SHA-1 signatures in TLS handshakes, as recommended in [RFC 9155](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9155.html).
* OpenTofu's remote provisioners, when using SSH to connect to a remote server using certificate-based authentication, no longer accept a certificate key as the signature key for a certificate, as required by [draft-miller-ssh-cert-03 section 2.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-miller-ssh-cert-03#section-2.1.1).

    This may cause new failures if you are currently using an incorrectly-generated certificate, but does not affect correctly-generated certificates.
* The `azurerm` backend has been heavily rewritten. Deprecated Azure libraries for the `azurerm` backend have been swapped out for modern, offically supported ones. ([#3034](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3034))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* The conditional enabled field is now supported for all types of resources within the `lifecycle` block. ([#3042](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3042))
* OpenTofu will now suggest using `-exclude` if a provider reports that it cannot create a plan for a particular resource instance due to values that won't be known until the apply phase. ([#2643](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2643))
* `tofu validate` now supports running in a module that contains provider configuration_aliases. ([#2905](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2905))
* The `regex` and `regexall` functions now support using `\p` and `\P` sequences with the long-form names for Unicode general character properties. For example, `\p{Letter}` now has the same meaning as `\p{L}`. ([#3166](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3166))
* `tofu show` now supports `-config` and `-module=DIR` options, to be used in conjunction with `-json` to produce a machine-readable summary of either the whole configuration or a single module without first creating a plan. ([#2820](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2820), [#3003](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3003))
* [The JSON representation of configuration](https://opentofu.org/docs/internals/json-format/#configuration-representation) returned by `tofu show` in `-json` mode now includes type constraint information for input variables and whether each input variable is required, in addition to the existing properties related to input variables. ([#3013](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3013))
* Multiline string updates in arrays are now diffed line-by-line, rather than as a single element, making it easier to see changes in the plan output. ([#3030](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3030))
* Add full support for -var, -var-file, and TF_VARS during `tofu apply` to support plan encryption ([#1998](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/1998))
* The S3 state backend now supports arguments to specify tags of the state and lock files. [#3038](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3038)
* Plan UI now explicitly states that the "update in-place" notation is "current -> planned", as part of the existing description of the meaning of each change type symbol. ([#3159](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3159))
* Upgrade go from 1.24.4 to 1.24.6 to fix [GO-2025-3849](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3849) ([3127](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3127))
* Improved error messages when a submodule is not found in a module ([#3144]https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3144)
* Add support for the `for_each` attribute in the `mock_provider` block. ([#3087](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3087))
* Upgrade github.com/openbao/openbao/api/v2 from 2.1.0 to 2.3.0 to fix [GO-2025-3783](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3783) ([#3134](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3134))
  * The upgrade is necessary to silence the security scanner and does not affect the actual state encryption provided by OpenBao.
* Add logs for the DynamoDB operations in the S3 backend ([#3103](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3103))
* When running the `stty` program to disable or reenable local echo at a sensitive input prompt, OpenTofu will now search `PATH` for the program rather than requiring it to be at exactly `/bin/stty`. ([#3182](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3182))
* Reduced the CPU and Memory overhead of managing large state files in OpenTofu. ([#3110](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3110))
  * These improvements are primarilly visible in projects with thousands of resources
* It is now possible to configure the registry protocol retry count and request timeout settings in the CLI configuration, in addition to the previously-available environment variables. ([#3256](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3256))
* Upgrade github.com/hashicorp/go-getter to v1.7.9 to fix [GO-2025-3892](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3892). ([#3227](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3227))
* The module installer will copy files in parallel to improve performance of `init` ([#3214](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3214))
* The following configuration options have been added to the `azurerm` backend:
  * `use_cli`: set to true by default, this can be set to false to disable command line authentcation. ([#3034](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3034))
  * `use_aks_workload_identity`: set to false by default, this allows authentication in Azure Kubernetes when using Workload Identity Federation. ([#3251](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3251))
  * `client_id_file_path`: allows the user to set the `client_id` through a file. ([#3251](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3251))
  * `client_secret_file_path`: allows the user to set the `client_secret` through a file. ([#3251](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3251))
  * `client_certificate`: allows the user to set the certificate directly, as opposed to only setting it through a file. ([#3251](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3251))
* Upgrade github.com/go-viper/mapstructure/v2 to v2.4.0 to fix [GO-2025-3900](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3900). ([#3229](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3229))

BUG FIXES:

* The `tofu.rc` configuration file now properly takes precedence over `terraform.rc` on Windows ([#2891](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2891))
* S3 backend now correctly sends the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header for the lockfile ([#2870](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/2970))
* The `import` block now correctly validates the `id` property. ([#2416](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/2416)
* Allow function calls in test variable blocks ([#2947](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2947))
* The `issensitive` function now returns an unknown result when its argument is unknown, since a sensitive unknown value can potentially become non-sensitive once more information is available. ([#3008](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3008))
* Provider references like "null.some_alias[each.key]" in .tf.json files are now correctly parsed ([#2915](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/2915))
* Fixed crash when processing multiple deprecated marks on a complex object ([#3105](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3105))
* Variables with validation no longer interfere with the destroy process ([#3131](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3131))
* Ensure that generated mock values for testing correctly follows the provider schema. ([#3069](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3069))
* Remote provisioners now reject SSH certificates whose signature key is a certificate key, as required by the current SSH Certificate Format specification draft. ([#3180](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3180))
* `tofu import` command now correctly validates when the target address contains non-existent for_each key ([#3106](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3106))
* Fix crash in tofu test when using deprecated outputs ([#3249](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3249))

BREAKING CHANGES:
* In the `azurerm` backend, the following backend variables have been changed ([#3034](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3034)):
  * `endpoint` and the `ARM_ENDPOINT` environment variable are deprecated: these are now unused and have no affect on execution
  * `msi_endpoint` and the `ARM_MSI_ENDPOINT` environment variable deprecated: please use the `MSI_ENDPOINT` environment variable instead
  * You cannot set both an `environment` and `metadata_host`.
