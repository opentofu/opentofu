        # Thank you for opening a feature request.
        
        In order to make your feature request a success, here are some simple tips to follow:
        
        1. Try to describe what you need to achieve rather than how you would like to change OpenTofu to change.
        2. Be as specific as possible. Overarching large changes to OpenTofu have a lower chance of getting accepted than specific changes.
        3. Describe how it affects your current project specifically. Try to support it with specific code and describe why the current situation is unsatisfactory.
