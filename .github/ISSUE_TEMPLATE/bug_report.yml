        # Thank you for opening an issue.
        
        The [OpenTofu](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu) issue tracker is reserved for bug reports relating to the core OpenTofu CLI application and configuration language.
        
        ## Filing a bug report
        
        To fix problems, we need clear reproduction cases - we need to be able to see it happen locally. A reproduction case is ideally something any engineer can git-clone or copy-paste and run immediately, without inventing any details or context.
        
        * A short example can be directly copy-pasteable; longer examples should be in separate git repositories, especially if multiple files are needed
        * Please include all needed context. For example, if you figured out that an expression can cause a crash, put the expression in a variable definition or a resource
        * Set defaults on (or omit) any variables. The person reproducing it should not need to invent variable settings
        * If multiple steps are required, such as running tofu twice, consider scripting it in a simple shell script. Providing a script can be easier than explaining what changes to make to the config between runs.
        * Omit any unneeded complexity: remove variables, conditional statements, functions, modules, providers, and resources that are not needed to trigger the bug

        Full debug output can be obtained by running OpenTofu with the environment variable `TF_LOG=trace`.
        Please create a GitHub Gist containing the debug output. Please do _not_ paste the debug output in the issue,
        since debug output is long. Debug output may contain sensitive information.
        
        **âš  Warning!** Carefully inspect the `TRACE` level OpenTofu logs! They may contain sensitive credentials.
        When in doubt, you can omit posting the logs and provide information later.
