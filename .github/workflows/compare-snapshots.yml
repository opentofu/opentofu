# This workflow runs on pull requests to ensure that the snapshots produced by
# the equivalence tests are consistent with the snapshots that are checked in.
#
# If there is an inconsistency, it is the responsibility of the committer to
# review it, ensure that any changes are intentional, and then commit the new
# snapshots.
