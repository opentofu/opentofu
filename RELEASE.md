**Release Support Policy**
========================

## **Release Cycle**
- We do not currently have a fixed release cycle.

## **Support Duration**
- Three releases: We currently support up to three releases at any given point in time. This means patches will be released for the most recent major release, as well as up to two prior ones.

## **Documentation**
- For each minor version (e.g., 1.6, 1.7) and the development version (corresponding to the main branch), detailed release notes will be provided.

## **Compatibility**
-	To check the compatibility of OpenTofu with Terraform, refer to the ([Migration guide](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/migration/))

## **Nightly Builds**
- Nightly builds are currently being trialled experimentally, these builds will be removed after 30 days and are not intended for usage in production environments ever.
