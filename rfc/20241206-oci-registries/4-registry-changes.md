As outlined in the [Design Considerations](3-design-considerations.md), we intend to start supporting the publication of SBOM artifacts. This requires changes to the existing OpenTofu registry and an extension to the [Provider Registry Protocol](https://opentofu.org/docs/internals/provider-registry-protocol/) and the [Module Registry Protocol](https://opentofu.org/docs/internals/module-registry-protocol/).

The changes required to the registry are detailed in a separate RFC titled [Strengthening supply chain security: SBOMs and more](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2494).
