We have run a survey on the OCI feature among the OpenTofu community, which attracted 103 responses. This document discusses this survey and the conclusions we draw from it. In addition to this document, you can also [download the cleaned up responses here](survey-results.json). Please note that we have cleaned up the survey responses to remove duplicate manual responses and reworded manual responses to make identifying individual respondents based on language impossible.
