# Provider Client Library

## Summary

This document specifies the provider client library that acts as a multiplexer between different provider protocols, abstracting the differences between Terraform providers (gRPC) and OpenTofu providers (stdio). But also it acts as a publicly consumable package that can be used outside of OpenTofu to communicate to providers in a standardized way.
