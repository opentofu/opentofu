**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Please avoid working on features or refactor without [an `accepted` and `help-wanted` issue](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccepted+label%3A"help+wanted"). OpenTofu is a large and complex project and every change needs careful consideration. We cannot merge pull requests without first having a discussion about them, no matter how trivial the issue may seem.
