  The nested `cloud` block configures OpenTofu's integration with a cloud backend.
---

# Cloud Configuration

The main module of an OpenTofu configuration can integrate with a cloud backend to enable its [CLI-driven run workflow](../../cli/cloud/index.mdx) (if supported by your cloud backend). You only need to configure these settings when you want to use OpenTofu CLI to interact with a cloud backend.
A cloud backend ignores them when interacting with OpenTofu through version control or the API.

## Usage Example

To configure the cloud CLI integration, add a nested `cloud` block within the `terraform` block. You cannot use the CLI integration and a state backend in the same configuration.

Refer to [Using the Cloud Backend](../../cli/cloud/index.mdx) in the OpenTofu CLI documentation for full configuration details, migration instructions, and command line arguments.

```hcl
locals {
	org = "example_corp"
}

terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = local.org
    hostname = "app.example.io"

    workspaces {
      tags = ["app"]
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
Cloud fields may not contain any references to data in the state or provider defined functions. All values must be able to be resolved during `tofu init` before the state is available.
