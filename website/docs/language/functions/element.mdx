# `element` Function

`element` retrieves a single element from a list.

```hcl
element(list, index)
```

The index is zero-based. This function produces an error if used with an
empty list.

Use the built-in index syntax `list[index]` in most cases. Use this function
only for the special additional "wrap-around" behavior described below.

## Examples

If the given index is less than the length of the given list then this
function is equivalent to the normal index operator:

```
> element(["a", "b", "c"], 1)
"b"
> ["a", "b", "c"][1]
"b"
```

However, this function exists mainly for the special way it treats indices that
are out of range for the list's length, which would therefore cause an error
if used with the normal index operator.

If the given index is greater than the length of the list then the index is
"wrapped around" by taking the index modulo the length of the list:

```
> element(["a", "b", "c"], 3)
"a"
```

This wrap-around behavior also works in the negative direction, so you can
use negative indices to select elements relative to the end of the given
list:

```
> element(["a", "b", "c"], -1)
"c"
```
