  Write-only attributes are special attributes within resources which can work with ephemeral
  values. These attributes are sent to the provider, but not returned.  This allows resources to
  manage sensitive data, without exposing it in the state or plan.

# Write-only attributes

:::info
Write-only attributes can be used only with OpenTofu v1.11 onwards.
:::

This attribute is only found in [`managed resources`](../resources/index.mdx)
designed to accept transient values that will never be stored in the state or plan.
For example, a secret can be read by using an ephemeral resource and then passed into the write-only
attribute `password_wo` of a managed resource.

The lifecycle of these attributes is quite different compared with other types of attributes:
* A write-only attribute exists only in the configuration section of a resource
* A write-only attribute will always be written into the state and plan with a null value
* A write-only attribute will always be returned as null from the provider even if in the configuration it had an actual value
* A write-only attribute can reference regular and ephemeral values (normal attributes cannot reference ephemeral values)

## Rendering
When present in the plan/apply cli output, it will *always* be displayed as `(write-only attribute)`.

## Updating a write-only attribute
As OpenTofu has no way to know what value is currently in the remote resource (ie: null value in the state) and
doesn't know what value has been (or planned to be) stored remotely (ie: provider returns null value for these attributes), it
cannot generate a change for such attributes.
As a recommendation for the provider authors, alongside the write-only attribute, there should be included
also a non-write-only attribute meant to instruct the provider that the value given in the configuration
of the write-only attribute should be used to update the resource.

For example, [aws_secretsmanager_secret_version](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/hashicorp/aws/v6.11.0/docs/resources/secretsmanager_secret_version)
offers 2 fields for this: `secret_string_wo` which is the write-only attribute and `secret_string_wo_version` that is
the non-write-only attribute. By changing the value of `secret_string_wo_version` from what is stored currently in the state,
provider will trigger an update of the `secret_string_wo` attribute with the value provided in the configuration.

## Example
