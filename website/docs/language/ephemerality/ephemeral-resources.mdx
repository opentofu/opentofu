# Ephemeral resources

:::info
Ephemeral resources can be used only with OpenTofu from v1.11 onwards.
:::

The `ephemeral` block defines a temporary value that OpenTofu will not store in state or plan.
This block works only with providers that already offer such capability and is not meant to be used
as a drop-in replacement of other blocks (`data` or `resource`). To understand if providers offer
such capability, the provider documentation or schema should be consulted.

## Lifecycle
The lifecycle of an ephemeral resource is different than the lifecycle of other resource types.
When OpenTofu encounters such a block, it will execute the following sequence:
* Validate the configuration using the specified provider.
* Open the ephemeral resource to retrieve the value from the provider.
* Close the the ephemeral resource when is no longer needed in the execution of the current phase

Any attribute of the response returned by opening the ephemeral resource, is marked as `ephemeral` and can only be used in specific contexts:
* Ephemeral Resource Configuration
* [Provider Configuration](../providers/configuration.mdx)
* Values for [write-only attributes](./write-only-attributes.mdx)
* [Ephemeral Variables](../values/variables.mdx#ephemerality)
* [Ephemeral Outputs](../values/outputs.mdx#ephemerality)
* [Locals](../values/locals.mdx#ephemerality)
* [Resource `provisioner` blocks](../resources/provisioners/syntax.mdx#suppressing-provisioner-logs-in-cli-output)
* [Resource `connection` blocks](../resources/provisioners/connection.mdx#ephemeral-usage)

Any usage of an `ephemeral` value in contexts where is not allowed will generate an error.

## Configuration structure
Besides the attributes in the schema of an ephemeral resource, the block supports also the following meta-arguments:
* [`depends_on`](../../language/meta-arguments/depends_on.mdx)
* [`count`](../../language/meta-arguments/count.mdx)
* [`for_each`](../../language/meta-arguments/for_each.mdx)
* [`provider`](../../language/meta-arguments/resource-provider.mdx)
* [`lifecycle`](../../language/meta-arguments/lifecycle.mdx)
  * Only [`precondition` and `postcondition`](../../language/expressions/custom-conditions.mdx#preconditions-and-postconditions)

## Deferred opening
By design, the ephemeral resources cannot be opened if the configuration is not fully known.
When that happens during planning, the ephemeral resource will be postponed (deferred) for the apply phase.
On the apply phase, based on the dependency graph, the ephemeral resource will be opened only
after all of its dependencies will be satisfied.
