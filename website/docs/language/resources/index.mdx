# Resources

_Resources_ are the most important element in the OpenTF language.
Each resource block describes one or more infrastructure objects, such
as virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such
as DNS records.

- [Resource Blocks](/opentf/language/resources/syntax) documents
  the syntax for declaring resources.

- [Resource Behavior](/opentf/language/resources/behavior) explains in
  more detail how OpenTF handles resource declarations when applying a
  configuration.

- The Meta-Arguments section documents special arguments that can be used with
  every resource type, including
  [`depends_on`](/opentf/language/meta-arguments/depends_on),
  [`count`](/opentf/language/meta-arguments/count),
  [`for_each`](/opentf/language/meta-arguments/for_each),
  [`provider`](/opentf/language/meta-arguments/resource-provider),
  and [`lifecycle`](/opentf/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle).

- [Provisioners](/opentf/language/resources/provisioners/syntax)
  documents configuring post-creation actions for a resource using the
  `provisioner` and `connection` blocks. Since provisioners are non-declarative
  and potentially unpredictable, we strongly recommend that you treat them as a
  last resort.
