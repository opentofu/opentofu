# Installing OpenTofu via Snapcraft (Linux)

OpenTofu is available on [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/) and you can install it by running:

```bash
snap install --classic opentofu
```

Snap is available by default on Ubuntu Linux and [can be installed on other Linux distributions, too](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd).
