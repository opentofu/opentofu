# Use OpenTofu as Docker Image

OpenTofu is available as [OCI container images](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pkgs/container/opentofu),
and distributed via public GitHub Packages registry.

:::warning Warning!

Do not use the OCI container image as a base image. This is not supported and will stop working with OpenTofu 1.10.
Instead, follow the [instructions below to build your own OpenTofu image](#building-your-own-image).

:::

## Versions

Images are hosted as packages in the OpenTofu GitHub organization. See the list
of available versions [here](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pkgs/container/opentofu/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged).

The multi-platform images are available using the following tags:

- `latest`: latest overall version of OpenTofu,
- `Major`: a specific major version of OpenTofu,
- `Major`.`Minor`: a specific minor version of OpenTofu,
- `Major`.`Minor`.`Patch`: a specific patch version of OpenTofu,

To pull platform-specific images (`amd64`, `arm`, `arm64`, `386`) use:

- `<Version>`-`<Platform>`: a platform specific version of OpenTofu.

## Usage

:::note
If you run into rate limiting issues with GitHub, create a
[Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and
[log in](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry)
to the registry.
:::

:::note
In the examples below you should have at least one `.tf` file located in the folder you are running the `docker` command.

To pull the image from GitHub Packages registry:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{DockerPullScript}</CodeBlock>

To run OpenTofu as a Docker container:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{DockerRunScript}</CodeBlock>

## Building your own image

The OCI image published by OpenTofu is intended as a basic command line tool. If you need additional tools in the image
or want to build services on top of OpenTofu, you will need to build your own image.

### Step 1: Obtaining the installation script

OpenTofu publishes POSIX/Powershell installation scripts. You can use these scripts to safely install OpenTofu in your
container image. Please follow the [standalone installation instructions](standalone.mdx) to obtain the installation
script and place it next to your `Dockerfile`/`Containerfile`.

### Step 2: Creating a stage for installation

Next, you can start creating a download stage in your `Dockerfile`/`Containerfile`. For details on multi-stage builds
please read the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/).

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20 AS tofu

ADD install-opentofu.sh /install-opentofu.sh
RUN chmod +x /install-opentofu.sh
RUN apk add gpg gpg-agent
RUN ./install-opentofu.sh --install-method standalone --install-path / --symlink-path -
```

### Step 3: Creating your own image

Now you can add your image below the installation stage and copy the `tofu` binary into it:

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20 AS tofu

ADD install-opentofu.sh /install-opentofu.sh
RUN chmod +x /install-opentofu.sh
RUN apk add gpg gpg-agent
RUN ./install-opentofu.sh --install-method standalone --install-path / --symlink-path -

## This is your stage:
FROM ubuntu
COPY --from=tofu /tofu /usr/local/bin/tofu

# Add your commands here
```
