# Use OpenTofu as Docker Image

OpenTofu is available as [OCI container images](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pkgs/container/opentofu),
and distributed via public GitHub Packages registry.

:::warning Warning!

Do not use the OCI container image as a base image. This is not supported and will stop working with OpenTofu 1.10.
Instead, follow the [instructions below to build your own OpenTofu image](#building-your-own-image).

:::

## Versions

Images are hosted as packages in the OpenTofu GitHub organization. See the list
of available versions [here](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pkgs/container/opentofu/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged).

The multi-platform images are available using the following tags:

- `latest`: latest overall version of OpenTofu,
- `Major`: a specific major version of OpenTofu,
- `Major`.`Minor`: a specific minor version of OpenTofu,
- `Major`.`Minor`.`Patch`: a specific patch version of OpenTofu,

Additionally, we make the following minimal tags available for [building a custom image](#building-your-own-image) starting with OpenTofu version 1.9.1:

- `minimal`: minimal image containing only the OpenTofu binary at `/usr/local/bin/tofu`
- `Major-minimal`: minimal image of a specific major version of OpenTofu,
- `Major.Minor-minimal`: minimal image of a specific minor version of OpenTofu,
- `Major.Minor.Patch-minimal`: minimal image of a specific patch version of OpenTofu.

To pull platform-specific images (`amd64`, `arm`, `arm64`, `386`) use:

- `<Version>`-`<Platform>`: a platform specific version of OpenTofu.
- `<Version>`-`minimal`-`<Platform>`: a platform specific minimal version of OpenTofu.

## Usage

:::note
If you run into rate limiting issues with GitHub, create a
[Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and
[log in](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry)
to the registry.
:::

:::note
In the examples below you should have at least one `.tf` file located in the folder you are running the `docker` command.

## Building your own image

The OCI image published by OpenTofu is intended as a basic command line tool. If you need additional tools in the image
or want to build services on top of OpenTofu, you will need to build your own image. You can do this in two ways:

1. Base your image on a minimal image (`ghcr.io/opentofu/opentofu:minimal` or similar) and use a multi-stage build to copy the `tofu` binary to your image.
2. Use the standalone installation script to install `tofu` into your container image.

### Method 1: using a multi-stage build

Assuming you want to use Alpine Linux, your `Dockerfile`/`Containerfile` could look like this:

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/opentofu/opentofu:minimal AS tofu

FROM alpine

COPY --from=tofu /usr/local/bin/tofu /usr/local/bin/tofu

# Your other build instructions
```

:::note

Consider locking down the version to a specific layer SHA hash and update only when needed in order to get the benefit of integrity verification.

:::

### Method 2: Using the installation script

#### Step 1: Obtaining the installation script

OpenTofu publishes POSIX/Powershell installation scripts. You can use these scripts to safely install OpenTofu in your
container image. Please follow the [standalone installation instructions](standalone.mdx) to obtain the installation
script and place it next to your `Dockerfile`/`Containerfile`.

#### Step 2: Creating a stage for installation

Next, you can start creating a download stage in your `Dockerfile`/`Containerfile`. For details on multi-stage builds
please read the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/).

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20 AS tofu

ADD install-opentofu.sh /install-opentofu.sh
RUN chmod +x /install-opentofu.sh
RUN apk add gpg
RUN ./install-opentofu.sh --install-method standalone --install-path / --symlink-path -
```

#### Step 3: Creating your own image

Now you can add your image below the installation stage and copy the `tofu` binary into it:

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20 AS tofu

ADD install-opentofu.sh /install-opentofu.sh
RUN chmod +x /install-opentofu.sh
RUN apk add gpg
RUN ./install-opentofu.sh --install-method standalone --install-path / --symlink-path -

## This is your stage:
FROM ubuntu
COPY --from=tofu /tofu /usr/local/bin/tofu

# Add your commands here
```
