# Installing OpenTofu on .deb-based Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)

<Buildkite />

You can install OpenTofu from our Debian repository by following the step-by-step instructions below.

## Installing using the installer

You can use the OpenTofu installer script to run the installation.

<CodeBlock language="bash">{DebConvenienceScript}</CodeBlock>

## Step-by-step instructions

The following steps explain how to set up the OpenTofu Debian repositories. These instructions should work on most Debian-based Linux systems.

### Installing tooling

In order to add the repositories, you will need to install some tooling. On most Debian-based operating systems, these tools will already be installed.

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{DebStep1Script}</CodeBlock>

### Set up the OpenTofu repository

First, you need to make sure you have a copy of the OpenTofu GPG key. This verifies that your packages have indeed been created using the official pipeline and have not been tampered with.

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{DebStep2Script}</CodeBlock>

Now you have to create the OpenTofu source list.

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{DebStep3Script}</CodeBlock>

### Installing OpenTofu

Finally, you can install OpenTofu:

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{DebStep4Script}</CodeBlock>
