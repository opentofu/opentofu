# Upgrading from OpenTofu 1.6.x/1.7.x

OpenTofu 1.8.x is mostly compatible with OpenTofu 1.6.x and 1.7.x (other than one minor breaking change in the S3 backend). This migration guide will take you through the process of
upgrading OpenTofu to version 1.8.0.

## Step 0: Prepare a disaster recovery plan

Although OpenTofu 1.8 is mostly compatible with version 1.6 and 1.7, you should take the necessary precautions to prevent
accidents. Make sure you have an up to date and *tested* disaster recovery plan.

## Step 1: Remove any use of `use_legacy_workflow` from S3 backend configurations, if any

If you are using the S3 backend, with `use_legacy_workflow` set, you'd have to remove it. This field has been deprecated in version 1.7.0, and has been changed to default to `false`.
The legacy workflow of authentication is no longer supported. Please start using the new authentication method, which is more consistent with other AWS tools

## Step 2: Apply all changes with OpenTofu 1.6.x/1.7.x

Before proceeding, make sure that you apply all changes with `tofu apply`. Running `tofu plan` should result
in no planned changes. While you can switch to OpenTofu with pending changes, it is not recommended.

```
$ tofu plan

...

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

OpenTofu has compared your real infrastructure against your
configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.
```

## Step 3: Install OpenTofu 1.8.x

As a first step, please [follow the installation instructions for the OpenTofu CLI tool](intro/install/index.mdx). Please test
if you can successfully execute the `tofu` command and receive the correct version:

```
$ tofu --version
OpenTofu v1.8.0
on linux_amd64
```

## Step 4: Back up your state file

Before you begin using the `tofu` binary on your Terraform code, make sure to back up your state file. If you are using
a local state file, you can simply make a copy of your `terraform.tfstate` file in your project directory.

If you are using a remote backend such as an S3 bucket, make sure that you follow the backup procedures for the
backend and that you exercise the restore procedure at least once.

## Step 5: Initialize OpenTofu 1.8.x

:::warning

Should any of the following steps fail, please do not proceed and follow the
[rollback instructions below](#rolling-back-and-reporting-issues) instead.
If you suspect the failure may be the result of a bug in OpenTofu,
[please help us by opening an issue](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues).

:::

Now you are ready to migrate. Run `tofu init` in the directory where your code resides. OpenTofu will download
any providers and modules referenced in your configuration from the OpenTofu registry.

## Step 6: Inspect the plan

Once initialized, run `tofu plan` and ensure that there are no pending changes similar to step 1 above. If there are
unexpected changes in the plan, roll back to OpenTofu 1.6.x/1.7.x and troubleshoot your migration. (See the Troubleshooting
section below.)

```
$ tofu plan

...

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

OpenTofu has compared your real infrastructure against your
configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.
```

## Step 7: Test out a small change

Before you begin using OpenTofu for larger changes, test out `tofu apply` with a smaller, non-critical
change.

## Rolling back and reporting issues

If you have issues migrating to OpenTofu you can follow these steps to roll back to OpenTofu 1.6.x/1.7.x:

1. Create another backup of your state file.
2. Remove OpenTofu 1.8.x and verify that you are running OpenTofu 1.6.x/1.7.x.
3. Run `tofu init`.
4. Run `tofu plan` and verify that no unexpected changes are in the plan.
5. Test the rollback with a small, non-critical change.

If you encountered a bug, [please report it on GitHub](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the migration to OpenTofu, you can join the <a href="/slack/">OpenTofu Slack</a> or ask on
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/opentofu/discussions).

### Error: Failed to query available provider packages

This error happens when a provider you specified in your configuration is not available in the OpenTofu registry.
Please roll back to OpenTofu 1.6.x/1.7.x and make sure your code works with that version. If your code works, please
[submit an issue to include the provider in the registry](https://github.com/opentofu/registry/issues/).

### Error: Module not found

This error happens when a module you specified in your configuration is not available in the OpenTofu registry.
Please roll back to OpenTofu 1.6.x/1.7.x and make sure your code works with that version. If your code works, please
[submit an issue to include the module in the registry](https://github.com/opentofu/registry/issues/).
