# Migrating to OpenTofu from Terraform
## Before you begin

OpenTofu aims to maintain compatibility with Terraform configurations. While most Terraform code will work without modification, we recommend following our [migration guide](migration-guide) to ensure a smooth transition.

## Migration process overview

The migration process is designed to be safe and reversible:

1. **Back up your infrastructure state and code**
2. **Install OpenTofu**
3. **Initialize and verify your configuration**
4. **Test with a small change**

:::note
Do you have multiple Terraform configurations to migrate?

Some systems are built from multiple Terraform configurations that propagate data using the `terraform_remote_state` data source, which typically requires some additional care during migration.

For more information, refer to [Migrating interdependent Terraform configurations](multiple-configurations).
