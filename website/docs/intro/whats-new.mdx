## New features

### New built-in functions

New builtin provider functions added ([#2306](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2306)) :

- `provider::terraform::decode_tfvars` - Decode a TFVars file content into an object.
- `provider::terraform::encode_tfvars` - Encode an object into a string with the same format as a TFVars file.
- `provider::terraform::encode_expr` - Encode an arbitrary expression into a string with valid OpenTofu syntax.

## Improvements to existing features

### External programs as encryption key providers (experimental)

State encryption now supports using external programs as key providers. Additionally, the PBKDF2 key provider now supports chaining via the `chain` parameter. For details, [see the related documentation](../language/state/encryption.mdx#external-experimental)

This functionality is experimental and may be changed in future OpenTofu versions.

### Smaller improvements

* OpenTofu will now recommend using `-exclude` instead of `-target`, when possible, in the error messages about unknown values in `count` and `for_each` arguments, thereby providing a more definitive workaround. ([#2154](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2154))

## Deprecations

### Using `ghcr.io/opentofu/opentofu` as a base image

Using the `ghcr.io/opentofu/opentofu` image as a base image for custom images is deprecated and doesn't work as of OpenTofu 1.10. The reason behind this change is security: while we regularly update OpenTofu itself when security-relevant updates arise, providing a base image would require an update roughly once a week, which we are currently not equipped to do.

However, we have added instructions on building your own base image in the [containerized installation instructions](./install/docker.mdx#building-your-own-image).

## Bugfixes

- Fixed an issue where an invalid provider name in the `provider_meta` block would crash OpenTofu rather than report an error ([#2347](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2347))
