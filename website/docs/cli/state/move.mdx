# Moving Resources

OpenTF's state associates each real-world object with a configured resource
at a specific [resource address](/docs/cli/state/resource-addressing). This
is seamless when changing a resource's attributes, but OpenTF will lose track
of a resource if you change its name, move it to a different module, or change
its provider.

Usually that's fine: OpenTF will destroy the old resource, replace it with a
new one (using the new resource address), and update any resources that rely on
its attributes.

In cases where it's important to preserve an existing infrastructure object, you
can explicitly tell OpenTF to associate it with a different configured
resource.

For most cases we recommend using
[the OpenTF language's refactoring features](/docs/language/modules/develop/refactoring)
to document in your module exactly how the resource names have changed over
time. OpenTF reacts to this information automatically during planning, so users of your module do not need to take any unusual extra steps.

There are some other situations which require explicit state modifications,
though. For those, consider the following OpenTF commands:

- [The `opentf state mv` command](/docs/cli/commands/state/mv) changes
  which resource address in your configuration is associated with a particular
  real-world object. Use this to preserve an object when renaming a resource, or
  when moving a resource into or out of a child module.

- [The `opentf state rm` command](/docs/cli/commands/state/rm) tells
  OpenTF to stop managing a resource as part of the current working directory
  and workspace, _without_ destroying the corresponding real-world object. (You
  can later use `opentf import` to start managing that resource in a
  different workspace or a different OpenTF configuration.)

- [The `opentf state replace-provider` command](/docs/cli/commands/state/replace-provider)
  transfers existing resources to a new provider without requiring them to be
  re-created.
