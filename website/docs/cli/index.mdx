# OpenTofu CLI Documentation

This is the documentation for OpenTofu CLI. It is relevant to anyone working
with OpenTofu's CLI-based workflows; this includes people who use OpenTofu CLI
by itself, as well as those who use OpenTofu CLI in conjunction with
[TACOS](../intro/tacos.mdx) (TF Automation and Collaboration Software).

Notably, this documentation does not cover the syntax and usage of the OpenTofu
language. For that, see the
[OpenTofu Language Documentation](../language/index.mdx).
