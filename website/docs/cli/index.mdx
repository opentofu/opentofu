# OpenTF CLI Documentation

This is the documentation for OpenTF CLI. It is relevant to anyone working
with OpenTF's CLI-based workflows; this includes people who use OpenTF CLI
by itself, as well as those who use OpenTF CLI in conjunction with
TACOS (TF Automation and Collaboration Software).

Notably, this documentation does not cover the syntax and usage of the OpenTF
language. For that, see the
[OpenTF Language Documentation](/docs/language).
