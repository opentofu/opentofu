# Command: force-unlock

Manually unlock the state for the defined configuration.

This will not modify your infrastructure. This command removes the lock on the
state for the current configuration. The behavior of this lock is dependent
on the backend being used. Local state files cannot be unlocked by another
process.

## Usage

Usage: `tofu force-unlock [options] LOCK_ID`

Manually unlock the state for the defined configuration.

This will not modify your infrastructure. This command removes the lock on the
state for the current configuration. The behavior of this lock is dependent
on the backend being used. Local state files cannot be unlocked by another
process.

:::note
Use of variables in [backend configuration](../../language/settings/backends/configuration.mdx#variables-and-locals),
or [encryption block](../../language/state/encryption.mdx#configuration)
requires [assigning values to root module variables](../../language/values/variables.mdx#assigning-values-to-root-module-variables)
when running `tofu force-unlock`.
:::

Options:

* `-force` -  Don't ask for input for unlock confirmation.

* `-var 'NAME=VALUE'` - Sets a value for a single
  [input variable](../../language/values/variables.mdx) declared in the
  root module of the configuration. Use this option multiple times to set
  more than one variable. Refer to
  [Input Variables on the Command Line](plan.mdx#input-variables-on-the-command-line) for more information.

* `-var-file=FILENAME` - Sets values for potentially many
  [input variables](../../language/values/variables.mdx) declared in the
  root module of the configuration, using definitions from a
  ["tfvars" file](../../language/values/variables.mdx#variable-definitions-tfvars-files).
  Use this option multiple times to include values from more than one file.

There are several other ways to set values for input variables in the root
module, aside from the `-var` and `-var-file` options. Refer to
[Assigning Values to Root Module Variables](../../language/values/variables.mdx#assigning-values-to-root-module-variables) for more information.
