# Command: show

The `opentf show` command is used to provide human-readable output
from a state or plan file. This can be used to inspect a plan to ensure
that the planned operations are expected, or to inspect the current state
as OpenTF sees it.

Machine-readable output is generated by adding the `-json` command-line
flag.

:::note
When using the `-json` command-line flag, any sensitive values in
OpenTF state will be displayed in plain text. For more information, see
[Sensitive Data in State](/docs/language/state/sensitive-data).
:::

## JSON Output

For OpenTF state files (including when no path is provided),
`opentf show -json` will show a JSON representation of the state.

For OpenTF plan files, `opentf show -json` will show a JSON representation
of the plan, configuration, and current state.

If you've updated providers which contain new schema versions since the state
was written, the state needs to be upgraded before it can be displayed with
`show -json`. If you are viewing a plan, it must be created without
`-refresh=false`. If you are viewing a state file, run `opentf refresh`
first.

The output format is covered in detail in [JSON Output Format](/docs/internals/json-format).

## Usage

Usage: `opentf show [options] [file]`

You may use `show` with a path to either a OpenTF state file or plan
file. If you don't specify a file path, OpenTF will show the latest state
snapshot.

This command accepts the following options:

* `-no-color` - Disables output with coloring

* `-json` - Displays machine-readable output from a state or plan file
