# Command: login

The `opentf login` command can be used to automatically obtain and save an
API token for any host that offers OpenTF-compatible services.

:::note
This command is suitable only for use in interactive scenarios
where it is possible to launch a web browser on the same host where OpenTF
is running. If you are running OpenTF in an unattended automation scenario,
you can
[configure credentials manually in the CLI configuration](/docs/cli/config/config-file#credentials).
:::

## Usage

Usage: `opentf login [hostname]`

## Credentials Storage

By default, OpenTF will obtain an API token and save it in plain text in a
local CLI configuration file called `credentials.tfrc.json`. When you run
`opentf login`, it will explain specifically where it intends to save
the API token and give you a chance to cancel if the current configuration is
not as desired.

If you don't wish to store your API token in the default location, you can
optionally configure a
[credentials helper program](/docs/cli/config/config-file#credentials-helpers) which knows
how to store and later retrieve credentials in some other system, such as
your organization's existing secrets management system.

## Login Server Support

The `opentf login` command works with any server supporting the
[login protocol](/docs/internals/login-protocol).
