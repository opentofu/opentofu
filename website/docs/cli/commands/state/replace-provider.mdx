# Command: state replace-provider

The `tofu state replace-provider` command is used to replace the provider
for resources in a [OpenTofu state](../../../language/state/index.mdx).

## Usage

Usage: `tofu state replace-provider [options] FROM_PROVIDER_FQN TO_PROVIDER_FQN`

This command will update all resources using the "from" provider, setting the
provider to the specified "to" provider. This allows changing the source of a
provider which currently has resources in state.

This command will output a backup copy of the state prior to saving any
changes. The backup cannot be disabled. Due to the destructive nature
of this command, backups are required.

:::note
Use of variables in [module sources](../../../language/modules/sources.mdx#support-for-variable-and-local-evaluation),
[backend configuration](../../../language/settings/backends/configuration.mdx#variables-and-locals),
or [encryption block](../../../language/state/encryption.mdx#configuration)
requires [assigning values to root module variables](../../../language/values/variables.mdx#assigning-values-to-root-module-variables)
when running `tofu state replace-providers`.
:::

This command also accepts the following options:

- `-auto-approve` - Skip interactive approval.

- `-lock=false` - Don't hold a state lock during the operation. This is
  dangerous if others might concurrently run commands against the same
  workspace.

- `-lock-timeout=0s` - Duration to retry a state lock.

- `-var 'NAME=VALUE'` - Sets a value for a single
  [input variable](../../../language/values/variables.mdx) declared in the
  root module of the configuration. Use this option multiple times to set
  more than one variable. Refer to
  [Input Variables on the Command Line](../plan.mdx#input-variables-on-the-command-line) for more information.

- `-var-file=FILENAME` - Sets values for potentially many
  [input variables](../../../language/values/variables.mdx) declared in the
  root module of the configuration, using definitions from a
  ["tfvars" file](../../../language/values/variables.mdx#variable-definitions-tfvars-files).
  Use this option multiple times to include values from more than one file.

There are several other ways to set values for input variables in the root
module, aside from the `-var` and `-var-file` options. Refer to
[Assigning Values to Root Module Variables](../../../language/values/variables.mdx#assigning-values-to-root-module-variables) for more information.

For configurations using the [`cloud` backend](../../../cli/cloud/index.mdx) or the [`remote` backend](../../../language/settings/backends/remote.mdx)
only, `tofu state replace-provider`
also accepts the option
[`-ignore-remote-version`](../../../cli/cloud/command-line-arguments.mdx#ignore-remote-version).

For configurations using
[the `local` state](../../../language/settings/backends/local.mdx) only,
`tofu state replace-provider` also accepts the legacy options
[`-state`, `-state-out`, and `-backup`](../../../language/settings/backends/local.mdx#command-line-arguments).

## Example

The example below replaces the `hashicorp/aws` provider with a fork by `acme`, hosted at a private registry at `registry.acme.corp`:

```shell
$ tofu state replace-provider hashicorp/aws registry.acme.corp/acme/aws
```
