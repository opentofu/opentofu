# Command: output

The `tofu output` command is used to extract the value of
an output variable from the state file.

## Usage

Usage: `tofu output [options] [NAME]`

With no additional arguments, `output` will display all the outputs for
the root module. If an output `NAME` is specified, only the value of that
output is printed.

:::note
Use of variables in [backend configuration](../../language/settings/backends/configuration.mdx#variables-and-locals)
or [encryption block](../../language/state/encryption.mdx#configuration)
requires [assigning values to root module variables](../../language/values/variables.mdx#assigning-values-to-root-module-variables)
when running `tofu output`.
:::

The command-line flags are all optional. The following flags are available:

* `-json` - If specified, the outputs are formatted as a JSON object, with
  a key per output. If `NAME` is specified, only the output specified will be
  returned. This can be piped into tools such as `jq` for further processing.

* `-raw` - If specified, OpenTofu will convert the specified output value to a
  string and print that string directly to the output, without any special
  formatting. This can be convenient when working with shell scripts, but
  it only supports string, number, and boolean values. Use `-json` instead
  for processing complex data types.

* `-no-color` - If specified, output won't contain any color.

* `-state=path` - Path to the state file. Defaults to "terraform.tfstate".
  Ignored when [remote state](../../language/state/remote.mdx) is used.

* `-var 'NAME=VALUE'` - Sets a value for a single
  [input variable](../../language/values/variables.mdx) declared in the
  root module of the configuration. Use this option multiple times to set
  more than one variable. Refer to
  [Input Variables on the Command Line](plan.mdx#input-variables-on-the-command-line) for more information.

* `-var-file=FILENAME` - Sets values for potentially many
  [input variables](../../language/values/variables.mdx) declared in the
  root module of the configuration, using definitions from a
  ["tfvars" file](../../language/values/variables.mdx#variable-definitions-tfvars-files).
  Use this option multiple times to include values from more than one file.

There are several other ways to set values for input variables in the root
module, aside from the `-var` and `-var-file` options. Refer to
[Assigning Values to Root Module Variables](../../language/values/variables.mdx#assigning-values-to-root-module-variables) for more information.

:::note
When using the `-json` or `-raw` command-line flag, any sensitive
values in OpenTofu state will be displayed in plain text. For more information,
see [Sensitive Data in State](../../language/state/sensitive-data.mdx).

## Examples

These examples assume the following OpenTofu output snippet.

```hcl
output "instance_ips" {
  value = aws_instance.web.*.public_ip
}

output "lb_address" {
  value = aws_alb.web.public_dns
}

output "password" {
  sensitive = true
  value = var.secret_password
}
```

To list all outputs:

```shellsession
$ tofu output
instance_ips = [
  "54.43.114.12",
  "52.122.13.4",
  "52.4.116.53"
]
lb_address = "my-app-alb-1657023003.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
password = <sensitive>
```

Note that outputs with the `sensitive` attribute will be redacted:

```shellsession
$ tofu output password
password = <sensitive>
```

To query for the DNS address of the load balancer:

```shellsession
$ tofu output lb_address
"my-app-alb-1657023003.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
```

To query for all instance IP addresses:

```shellsession
$ tofu output instance_ips
instance_ips = [
  "54.43.114.12",
  "52.122.13.4",
  "52.4.116.53"
]
```

## Use in automation

The `tofu output` command by default displays in a human-readable format,
which can change over time to improve clarity.

For scripting and automation, use `-json` to produce the stable JSON format.
You can parse the output using a JSON command-line parser such as
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

```shellsession
$ tofu output -json instance_ips | jq -r '.[0]'
54.43.114.12
```

For the common case of directly using a string value in a shell script, you
can use `-raw` instead, which will print the string directly with no extra
escaping or whitespace.

```shellsession
$ tofu output -raw lb_address
my-app-alb-1657023003.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

The `-raw` option works only with values that OpenTofu can automatically
convert to strings. Use `-json` instead, possibly combined with `jq`, to
work with complex-typed values such as objects.

OpenTofu strings are sequences of Unicode characters rather than raw bytes,
so the `-raw` output will be UTF-8 encoded when it contains non-ASCII
characters. If you need a different character encoding, use a separate command
such as `iconv` to transcode OpenTofu's raw output.
