# Command: get

The `tofu get` command is used to download and update
[modules](../../language/modules/develop/index.mdx) mentioned in the root module.

## Usage

working directory. Don't commit this directory to your version control
repository.

The `get` command supports the following option:

* `-update` - If specified, modules that are already downloaded will be
  checked for updates and the updates will be downloaded if present.

* `-no-color` - Disable text coloring in the output.

* `-json` Produce output in a machine-readable JSON format, suitable for use
  in text editor integrations and other automated systems. Always disables color.
