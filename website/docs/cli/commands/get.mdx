# Command: get

The `tofu get` command is used to download and update
[modules](../../language/modules/develop/index.mdx) mentioned in the root module.

## Usage

Usage: `tofu get [options]`

The modules are downloaded into a `.terraform` subdirectory of the current
working directory. Don't commit this directory to your version control
repository.

:::note
Use of [variables in module sources](../../language/modules/sources.mdx#support-for-variable-and-local-evaluation)
requires [assigning values to root module variables](../../language/values/variables.mdx#assigning-values-to-root-module-variables)
when running `tofu get`.
:::

The `get` command supports the following option:

* `-update` - If specified, modules that are already downloaded will be
  checked for updates and the updates will be downloaded if present.

* `-no-color` - Disable text coloring in the output.

* `-json` Produce output in a machine-readable JSON format, suitable for use
  in text editor integrations and other automated systems. Always disables color.

* `-var 'NAME=VALUE'` - Sets a value for a single
  [input variable](../../language/values/variables.mdx) declared in the
  root module of the configuration. Use this option multiple times to set
  more than one variable. Refer to
  [Input Variables on the Command Line](plan.mdx#input-variables-on-the-command-line) for more information.

* `-var-file=FILENAME` - Sets values for potentially many
  [input variables](../../language/values/variables.mdx) declared in the
  root module of the configuration, using definitions from a
  ["tfvars" file](../../language/values/variables.mdx#variable-definitions-tfvars-files).
  Use this option multiple times to include values from more than one file.

There are several other ways to set values for input variables in the root
module, aside from the `-var` and `-var-file` options. Refer to
[Assigning Values to Root Module Variables](../../language/values/variables.mdx#assigning-values-to-root-module-variables) for more information.
