# Provider Mirrors in OCI Registries

A "provider mirror" is a secondary location hosting a copy of a provider to be used instead
of accessing the provider's primary OpenTofu Provider Registry. Creating a local mirror of some
or all of the providers you use can reduce data transfer costs and can help with running
OpenTofu in "air-gapped" environments that cannot access any services over the public internet.

Alternative provider installation methods are configured as part of
[the OpenTofu CLI Configuration](../config/config-file.mdx). You can configure installation
from OCI Registries using an `oci_mirror` block as part of your
[Explicit Installation Method Configuration](../config/config-file.mdx#explicit-installation-method-configuration).

```hcl
provider_installation {
  oci_mirror {
    repository_template = "example.com/opentofu-providers/${namespace}/${type}"
    include             = ["registry.opentofu.org/*/*"]
  }
}
```

The above example specifies that any provider that belongs to the primary OpenTofu Registry
should instead be installed from a repository in an OCI registry, constructing the
repository address dynamically using the components of the provider source address.

For example, the provider source address `hashicorp/tls` is a shorthand for
`registry.opentofu.org/hashicorp/tls`, and so it matches the installation method rule
configured above, with `hashicorp` as the "namespace" and `tls` as the "type".
Therefore this configuration calls for the provider to be installed from the
repository named `opentofu-providers/hashicorp/tls` in the OCI registry running at
`example.com`.

## `oci_mirror` installation method arguments

- `repository_template`: A HCL-style template string that evaluates to an OCI repository
  address to use for a given provider.

    The following symbols are available for interpolation in the template:

    - `hostname`: The hostname of the primary registry that the provider belongs to,
      such as `registry.opentofu.org`.
    - `namespace`: The namespace that the provider belongs to within its origin registry,
      such as `hashicorp` in the above example.
    - `type`: The provider's "type" name, which is the final portion of the source address
      that's unique within a particular namespace, such as `tls` in the above example.

    The template **must** include an interpolation for any component of the provider source
    address that is not constrained exactly by the `include` argument. For example,
    setting `include = ["registry.opentofu.org/*/*"]` constrains to exactly one hostname
    but leaves the namespace and type wildcarded, and so the template must include
    an interpolation of each of `namespace` and `type`, but does not need to use `hostname`.

- `include` and `exclude`: Lists of provider source address patterns that together specify
  what subset of providers are to be handled by this installation method, as described
  in [Explicit Installation Method Configuration](../config/config-file.mdx#explicit-installation-method-configuration).

## Required OCI Repository Content

The OCI repository selected by `repository_template` must contain content following a
specific structure that allows OpenTofu to recognize the metadata for all of the
available provider versions and their associated distribution packages.

### Tag Names

OpenTofu begins by listing all of the tags in the repository. A valid tag name must
be a version number formatted using the syntax of
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), except that
the tag name must use the underscore character (`_`) instead of the plus
character (`+`) to delimit the optional "build metadata" portion.

OpenTofu ignores all tags that cannot be parsed as version numbers, and then selects
the greatest available version that matches all of the version constraints for this
provider specified across all modules in the current OpenTofu configuration.

### Manifest Structure

OpenTofu providers use separate distribution packages for each supported operating
system and CPU architecture, and so each tag in an OCI repository used as an
OpenTofu provider mirror must refer to an [Image Index](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.1.1/image-index.md)
manifest that lists a separate manifest for each platform the provider has been
compiled for.

The index manifest **must** have its `artifactType` property set to
`application/vnd.opentofu.provider` so that OpenTofu can recognize is as a
representing a provider release.

OpenTofu then searches the `manifests` array for a manifest descriptor
whose `artifactType` is `application/vnd.opentofu.provider-target`
and whose `platform` property matches the operating system and architecture
that OpenTofu itself was compiled for.

The selected descriptor is then used to retrieve an [Image Manifest](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.1.1/manifest.md)
representing the files and metadata needed to install the selected provider
version for the current platform. This manifest must again have
its `artifactType` set to `application/vnd.opentofu.provider-target`, to
match the descriptor used to retrieve it.

The image manifest's `layers` array must include exactly one descriptor
whose `mediaType` is `archive/zip`, referring to a blob containing exactly
the same `.zip` package that would be returned for the same version of
the provider on the same platform if installed from the provider's origin
registry.

OpenTofu than finally retrieves the indicated blob and extracts the `.zip`
archive into the provider cache directory so that it's available for use
by subsequent workflow commands like [`tofu apply`](../commands/apply.mdx).

## Assembling and Pushing Provider Manifests

:::note
This section currently describes a very manual process for constructing the
required manifest structure as described in the previous section.

The OpenTofu project is currently collaborating with the ORAS project to
design and implement a more complete solution, which will be documented here
once it's included in a generally-available ORAS release.
:::

### Install and Configure ORAS

We recommend assembling and pushing the manifests and blobs for a provider
using the CLI tool offered by [the ORAS project](https://oras.land/).
At the time of writing, multi-platform index support is not yet finalized
in ORAS and so unfortunately the index manifest must be constructed manually.

If you are installing and using ORAS for the first time, and you intend to
push to an OCI registry that requires authentication, you will need to first
obtain credentials for that repository using [`oras login`](https://oras.land/docs/commands/oras_login).

### Local OCI Image Layout

The process of assembling OpenTofu provider manifests with ORAS requires
multiple steps, and so we recommend pushing the various artifacts first
to a local filesystem directory -- known as an
[OCI Image Layout](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.1.1/image-layout.md) --
and then pushing the resulting objects all at once to your target repository,
to avoid making the intermediate steps visible to other users of the
remote repository.

The command line examples in the following sections use the ORAS option
`--oci-layout` to specify that the target of each operation is a local
filesystem directory called `tmp-layout`, in the current working directory.
You can change the name `tmp-layout` to whatever path you wish, as long
as you use a consistent pathname across all of the commands.

### Single-platform Image Manifests

The top-level index manifest will eventually refer to the manifests for
each of the platform-specific artifacts, and so the platform-specific
artifacts must be pushed first in order to construct their manifests
and determine the digests used to refer to them.

First you must obtain the official `.zip` distribution packages for
the provider you are intending to re-publish. For providers in the
official OpenTofu Registry you can find a link to the provider's
GitHub repository and retrieve the `.zip` artifacts from one of its
releases.

For example, to prepare to re-package the `hashicorp/tls` provider:

1. Access [the `hashicorp/tls` provider's registry index page](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/hashicorp/tls/latest).
2. Follow the "Repository" link in the navigation bar to [the provider's GitHub repository](https://github.com/opentofu/terraform-provider-tls).
3. Find the "Releases" heading in the repository's own navigation bar and select the latest release, such which at the time of writing was [v4.0.6](https://github.com/opentofu/terraform-provider-tls/releases/tag/v4.0.6).
4. Download the `.zip` assets for each platform you intend to include in your mirror into a new, empty directory on your local computer.

After switching to that directory in your shell, you should be able to list all of the packages you downloaded:

```shellsession
$ ls -1
terraform-provider-tls_4.0.6_darwin_amd64.zip
terraform-provider-tls_4.0.6_linux_386.zip
terraform-provider-tls_4.0.6_linux_amd64.zip
terraform-provider-tls_4.0.6_linux_arm.zip
terraform-provider-tls_4.0.6_linux_arm64.zip
terraform-provider-tls_4.0.6_windows_386.zip
terraform-provider-tls_4.0.6_windows_amd64.zip
terraform-provider-tls_4.0.6_windows_arm.zip
terraform-provider-tls_4.0.6_windows_arm64.zip
```

Use `oras push` for each package in turn to copy the `.zip` archive into your local OCI Image Layout and generate its manifest:

```shellsession
$ oras push \
    --artifact-type application/vnd.opentofu.provider-target \
    --artifact-platform linux/amd64 \
    --oci-layout tmp-layout:linux_amd64 \
    terraform-provider-tls_4.0.6_linux_amd64.zip:archive/zip

```

The `Digest` returned at the end of the output is the identifier for the platform-specific manifest.
The digest in the above example is a placeholder; your result will vary for each distinct
provider package.

Repeat the above command for each combination of operating system and CPU architecture
that you want to include in your mirror distribution. Once you've pushed all of the
packages you want to include, you can confirm all of the platform-specific tags you've
created:

```shellsession
$ oras repo tags --oci-layout tmp-layout
darwin_amd64
linux_386
linux_amd64
linux_arm
linux_arm64
windows_386
windows_amd64
windows_arm
windows_arm64
```

### Multi-platform Index Manifest

The current stable release of ORAS cannot construct and push an index manifest
directly, but the "OCI Image Layout" that you constructed in the previous step
includes its own index manifest that can be adapted to make it suitable for
pushing to a remote repository.

First, copy the Image Layout's index file to another file so that you can edit
it without damaging the Image Layout directory:

```shellsession
$ cp tmp-layout/index.json terraform-provider-tls_4.0.6.json
```

Open the new `terraform-provider-tls_4.0.6.json` file in your favorite text
editor. The JSON document is likely to be "minified", so you may wish to ask
your text editor to reformat it for readability before continuing.

The file should include a JSON property `"mediaType" : "application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json"`
representing that this is an OCI Index Manifest. After that property, add a new
JSON property `"artifactType":"application/vnd.opentofu.provider"` to represent
that this is an index for an OpenTofu provider artifact.

The file also includes a `"manifests"` property that describes each of the
platform-specific manifests previously created. Each of these descriptor
objects must contain a `"platform"` property specifying the platform that
the manifest is for. For example:

```json
{
  "artifactType": "application/vnd.opentofu.provider-target",
  "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
  "digest": "sha256:01d3ccf9747dd604ebaa314efbacf12e18a248f8bf1c783f5cbb220754954e67",
  "size": 606,
  "platform": {
    "os": "linux",
    "architecture": "amd64"
  }
}
```

Make sure that each of the manifest descriptors includes a `"platform"` property
specifying the correct operating system and CPU architecture for the associated
manifest.

You can then push this new index manifest into the OCI layout, along with all
of the single-platform artifacts pushed in the previous section:

```shellsession
$ oras manifest push --oci-layout tmp-layout:4.0.6 terraform-provider-tls_4.0.6.json 
Uploading da13ebaa32ba application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json
Uploaded  da13ebaa32ba application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json
Pushed: [oci-layout] tmp-layout:4.0.6
Digest: sha256:da13ebaa32ba856d75da18e38daabc7a65ac8853230dfcc817f8ccbac15b639a
```

Notice that the provider version 4.0.6 appears twice in this command line. The
first is the name of the tag to create in the OCI layout, while the second is
part of the filename of the index manifest saved in the previous step.

The OCI Image Layout now contains individual tags for the platform-specific
arfacts and also a version number tag representing the index manifest:

```shellsession
$ oras repo tags --oci-layout tmp-layout
4.0.6
darwin_amd64
linux_386
linux_amd64
linux_arm
linux_arm64
windows_386
windows_amd64
windows_arm
windows_arm64
```

### Push the Artifacts to a Remote Repository

The local image layout now contains all of the information required to push
this provider release to a remote repository.

```shellsession
$ oras cp \
   --from-oci-layout tmp-layout:4.0.6 \
   example.com/opentofu-providers/hashicorp/tls:4.0.6

```

ORAS copies everything that the local 4.0.6 tag refers to into the remote registry,
and then creates a remote tag 4.0.6 referring to the same content.

This provider is now available for use using an `oci_mirror` installation
block configured as in the example at the start of this page.
