# OCI Registry Integrations

Some of OpenTofu's features can be configured to interact with OCI Registries.

:::note
This section contains very early draft content for features that are still in development.

We've included it to support prerelease testing, but the information here may be incomplete and
anything documented in this section is subject to change before the final release.

## OCI Registry Credentials

By default, OpenTofu searches for OCI Registry credentials in the same locations as other
tools in the OCI ecosystem, such as Docker CLI, Podman, Buildah, ORAS, etc. If you have
already logged in to the registry you intend to use with the login facility from one of
these programs then OpenTofu should discover and use the configured credentials
automatically.

If you need more control over the behavior, refer to [OCI Registry Credentials](credentials.mdx).

## OpenTofu Modules in OCI Registries

OpenTofu supports OCI Registries as one of its many supported
[module source address types](/language/modules/sources.mdx).

No special configuration is required to enable this source address type aside from
ensuring that you have configured whatever credentials are needed to communicate
with the specified remote repository.

For more information on how to create suitable artifacts for use as OpenTofu module
packages, refer to [Module Packages in OCI Registries](module-package.mdx).

## OpenTofu Providers in OCI Registries

OpenTofu supports OCI Registries as a secondary installation source for provider plugin
packages. You can configure OpenTofu to retrieve some or all providers from an OCI
Registry instead of from each provider's primary OpenTofu Provider Registry.

For more information, refer to [Provider Mirrors in OCI Registries](provider-mirror.mdx).

OpenTofu does not yet support using an OCI Registry as the _primary_ installation source
for a provider, but we are hoping to allow that in a future version.
