### Agenda

### Getting Better About Communicating TSC Meetings

The committee discussed the need to improve communication about TSC meetings and the decisions made during them.

Going forward, a new process will be implemented to ensure that the community is kept informed about the TSC's activities:

- At the beginning of each meeting, the TSC will review an asynchronously authored summary of the previous meeting to ensure
that it accurately reflects the decisions made, and the thought process behind decisions is communicated effectively.
- Within 24 hours of the meeting, the TSC will publish the summary of the previous meeting to the OpenTofu community.
- Before the next meeting, someone from the TSC will volunteer to author the summary of the current meeting, and the process will
repeat.

The objective of this process is to ensure that the community is kept informed about the TSC's activities and decisions in a timely manner.

### Registry Policy

The committee continued discussions regarding this, and progress was made towards determining the best way to handle the policy.

The discussions included considerations like the following:

- How broad or specific the policy should be.
- How to handle the policy's enforcement.
- What the impact of the policy will be on the community.
