### Agenda

1. Comparison Table
   - Community members are asking for comparisons between OpenTofu and Terraform. It’s a tradeoff - on one hand it pushes us into the mindset of being a shadow-project, on the other hand it would ease the risk of migration and help those who value high levels of compatibility. It’s worth noting that the community has been creating similar tables already, like [nedinthecloud](https://nedinthecloud.com/2024/01/22/comparing-opentofu-and-terraform/).
   - ❌ Add a compatibility table to the website
      - Yes:
      - No: Unanimous
   - ✅ Emphasize on the website much more strongly that we are a “drop in” replacement (100% compatible with TF [1.xxx](http://1.xxx) to OpenTofu 1.xxx)
      - *Ask the dev team to think about how to get this done*
      - Yes: Roni, Roger, Igor, Jim
      - No: Wojciech
   - ✅ Add/improve page on “why OpenTofu” (rather than just a compatibility table)
      - *Ask the dev team to think about how to get this done*
      - Yes: Unanimous
      - No:
   - ❓Add a “check” command OpenTofu that lets you know if you’re good to migrate from Terraform to OpenTofu or using features that might conflict
      - *This was a split vote. So let’s ask the dev team to think about what’s possible here and to come back with a more concrete proposal and see what they think.*
      - Yes: Roger, Igor, Jim
      - No: Roni, Wojciech
   - ❌ Add a “check” command OpenTofu that lets you know if you’re good to migrate from OpenTofu back to Terraform or using features that might conflict
      - Yes: Jim
      - No: Roger, Igor, Roni, Wojciech
   - Research what other projects have done in terms of migration tools
      - *No vote necessary*
      - Anyone on steering committee can do this and come back with more info
   - ❌ Add a “compatibility mode” that blocks usage of OpenTofu features not in Terraform
      - Yes:
      - No: Unanimous
