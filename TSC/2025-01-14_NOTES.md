### Agenda
- Release process discussion.  Guiding principle decided "The policy should be guided by need to balance the desire to provide assurance to adopters with the resourcing required to maintain older versions, weâ€™re open to feedback"
- No formal votes.

### Discussion
- Discussion of release process, and that we think its important for enterprise support that we provide patches for every major version going back at least 1 year.  Christian agreed to discuss w/Core team.
- Discussion that regardless of final policy, we want to be explict about what versions are supported with e.g. an actual table on opentofu.org
- Discussion of how much traction we're seeing, especially post-releases.  Setup a download-tracker spreadsheet to track github release download counts, we don't do much else on reddit, linkedin etc.
- Discussion of getting feedback from TACOs for OpenTofu - "Make it Faster" - Add OpenTelemetry.
- Discussion of CNCF application and what steps are needed to continue to advance the application and gain an exception to the apache license policy
