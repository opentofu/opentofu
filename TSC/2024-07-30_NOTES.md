#### CDK-TF Compatibility Commitment

[Issue #1335](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1335)

As OpenTofu matures, many people who use existing tooling want to make sure that a switch will not break their workflow (now or in the future).
We are being asked what our long term approach to CDK-TF is.

Options:

- Do not make any statement or commitment
- Say that we will attempt to keep compatibility where possible but not make any commitment
- Keep compatibility where possible and commit to a fork if the projects need to diverge

This is one of several pieces of tooling where we are being asked questions about stability and long term commitments, with [setup-opentofu](https://github.com/opentofu/setup-opentofu/) being another frequently requested item.  In that case we have people offering to help support it once we commit to hosting it / managing the review/release process.

#### Discussion

- Christian – a lot of questions about CDK-TF, what is our policy on the tools built on top of Terraform. Shall we fork?
- Igor – what is the license of CDKTF?
- Christian: MPL
- Igor – we do not have time and resources to fork the CDKTF
- Igor – we could ask the community for help
- Wojciech – would love to see it a community project first and bring it later. It has a lot of potential.
- Christian – Accept community PRs and issues to keep OpenTofu compatible with CDKTF but no commitment to a fork.
- Igor - setup-opentofu helps drive adoption, we should evaluate making it a core team priority (small codebase / time investment)

#### Decision

The core team has not had bandwidth to take on CDKTF, but will accept community support efforts.
