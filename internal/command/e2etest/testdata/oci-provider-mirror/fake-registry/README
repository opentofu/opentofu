This directory contains a few "image layout" directories, as described in this
specification:
    https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.0/image-layout.md

We use these in conjunction with the fake OCI registry implementation in
package fakeocireg as part of end-to-end testing the provider installer's
"oci_mirror" installation method.

These fake repositories each contain valid metadata for some provider packages,
though the provider "executables" themselves are just placeholder text files
rather than real executable programs, since this is only intended for testing
provider installation and not for testing provider execution.
