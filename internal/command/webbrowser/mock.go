// MockLauncher is a mock implementation of Launcher that has some special
// behavior designed for use in unit tests.
//
// When OpenURL is called, MockLauncher will make an HTTP request to the given
// URL rather than interacting with a "real" browser.
//
// In normal situations it will then return with no further action, but if
// the response to the given URL is either a standard HTTP redirect response
// or includes the custom HTTP header X-Redirect-To then MockLauncher will
// send a follow-up request to that target URL, and continue in this manner
// until it reaches a URL that is not a redirect. (The X-Redirect-To header
// is there so that a server can potentially offer a normal HTML page to
// an actual browser while also giving a next-hop hint for MockLauncher.)
//
// Since MockLauncher is not a full programmable user-agent implementation
// it can't be used for testing of real-world web applications, but it can
// be used for testing against specialized test servers that are written
// with MockLauncher in mind and know how to drive the request flow through
// whatever steps are required to complete the desired test.
//
// All of the actions taken by MockLauncher happen asynchronously in the
// background, to simulate the concurrency of a separate web browser.
// Test code using MockLauncher should provide a context which is cancelled
// when the test completes, to help avoid leaking MockLaunchers.
