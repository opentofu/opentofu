// ResourceInstanceGlue describes a callback API that [ResourceInstance]
// objects use to ask the caller questions about the resource instance whose
// answers vary based on what phase we're currently evaluating for,
// what provider plugins are available, or any other concern that lives
// outside of this package.
//
// Real implementations of these methods are likely to block until some
// side-effects have occured elsewhere, such as asking a provider to produce a
// planned new state. If that external work depends on information coming from
// any other part of this package's API then the implementation of that
// MUST use the mechanisms from package grapheval in order to cooperate
// with the self-dependency detection used by this package to prevent
// deadlocks.

	// package focused only on the general concern of evaluating expressions
	// in the configuration.
	//
	// If this returns error diagnostics then it MUST also return a suitable
	// placeholder unknown value to use when evaluating downstream expressions.
	// If there's not enough information to return anything more precise
	// then returning [cty.DynamicVal] is an acceptable last resort.
