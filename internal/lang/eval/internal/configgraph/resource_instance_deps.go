// As an implementation detail within this package we use cty marks as the
// primary mechanism for tracking dependencies between resource instances:
// the object values representing resource instances are marked with the
// addrs.AbsResourceInstance they each belong to, so that any expressions
// deriving from those will automatically track that they are relying on
// a resource instance result.
//
// We don't expose these marks outside of the "internal/lang/eval" family
// of packages. The rest of the system only needs to know the relationships
// between resource instances as a whole, because operations on entire
// resource instances are our atomic unit of change as far as OpenTofu core
// is concerned.

// ResourceInstanceMark is a cty mark value used only internally within the
// evaluation system to track when a particular expression is derived from the
// result object for a resource instance.

// may or may not appear twice in the sequence. Deduplicating, if needed, is
// the caller's responsibility.
