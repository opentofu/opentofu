// CompiledModuleInstance is the interface implemented by the top-level object
// that our "module compiler" layer returns, which this package's exported
// functions use to access [configgraph] objects whose results we translate to
// the package's public API.
//
// A [CompiledModuleInstance] represents a top-level module instance _and_ all
// of the module instances beneath it. This is what ties together all of the
// [configgraph] nodes representing a whole configuration tree to provide
// global information. Logic in package eval typically interacts directly only
// with the [CompiledModuleInstance] object representing the root module of
// the configuration, but that object will internally use objects of this
// type to delegate to child module instances that might be using different
// implementations of this interface.
//
// This module instance boundary is therefore the layer that all language
// editions/experiments must agree on to some extent. Edition-based language
// evolution will need to carefully consider how to handle any feature that
// affects this API boundary between parent and child module instances, to
// ensure that modules of different editions are still able to interact
// successfully.

	// CheckAll collects diagnostics for everything in this module instance
	// and its child module instances, recursively.
	//
	// All callers in package eval should call this method at some point on every
	// [CompiledModuleInstance] they construct, because this is the only
	// method that guarantees to visit everything declared in the configuration
	// and make sure it gets a chance to evaluate itself and return diagnostics.
	// (Other methods will typically only interact with parts of the config
	// that are relevant to the questions they are answering.)
	//
	// If the [Glue] implementation passed to this module instance has
	// operations that block on the completion of outside operations then this
	// function must run concurrently with those outside operations (i.e. in
	// a separate goroutine) because CheckAll will block until all of the
	// values in the configuration have been resolved, which means that e.g.
	// in the planning phase this won't return until all resources have been
	// planned and so their "planned new state" values have been decided.

	// names match the output values declared in the child module, but we
	// don't enforce that at this layer to allow the result to potentially
	// use special cty features like marks and unknown values when needed.
	// Callers require this to be a known object type should work defensively
	// to do _something_ reasonable -- even if just returning an error message
