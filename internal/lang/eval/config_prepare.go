// prepareToPlan implements an extra preparation phase we perform before
// running the main plan phase so we can deal with the "chicken or the egg"
// problem of needing to evaluate configuraton to learn the relationships
// between resources instances and provider instances but needing to already
// know those relationships in order to fully evaluate the configuration.
//
// As a compromise then, we initially perform a more conservative walk that
// just treats all resource instances as having fully-unknown values so that
// we don't need to configure any providers or open any ephemeral resource
// instances, and then ask the resulting configgraph objects to report
// the resource/provider dependencies which we can then use on a subsequent
// re-eval that includes the real provider planning actions.
//
// This approach relies on the idea that an evaluation with more unknown
// values should always produce a superset of the true dependencies that
// would be reported once there are fewer unknown values, and so the
// result of this function should capture _at least_ the dependencies
// required to successfully plan, possibly also including some harmless
// additional dependency relationships that aren't strictly needed once we can
// evaluate using real resource planning results. The planning phase will
// then be able to produce its own tighter version of this information to
// use when building the execution graph for the apply phase.
