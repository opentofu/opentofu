// This test file contains a small collection of benchmarks, written using the benchmark
// mechanism offered as part of Go's testing library, of situations involving resources
// and modules that have a very large number of instances.
//
// OpenTofu's current design is aimed to support tens of instances as the typical case
// and low-hundreds of instances as an extreme case. These benchmarks intentionally
// ignore those design assumptions by testing with thousands of resource instances,
// since we know that some in our community use OpenTofu in that way and although it
// not officially supported we do wish to be able to more easily measure performance
// when someone reports a significant regression of performance when using an
// "unreasonable" number of instances (per OpenTofu's current design assumptions),
// or whenever we're intentionally attempting to change something in OpenTofu to
// improve performance.
//
// The existence of these benchmarks does not represent a commitment to support
// using OpenTofu with thousands of resource instances in the same configuration.
// We consider these situations to be "best effort" only.
//
// These benchmarks exercise the core language runtime only. Therefore they do not
// account for any additional overheads caused by behaviors at the CLI layer, such
// as remote state storage and the state snapshot serialization that implies, or
// the UI display hooks.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------

// This is an adaptation of a benchmark test of the same name in "package tofu"
// for comparison purposes.
//
// However, it's not yet really a fair comparison because the original form
// of this test covered a full plan/apply round whereas this is currently
// only performing validation because at the time of writing the plan/apply
// entry points are not written yet.
//
// However, "validate" in this package actually does instance expansion while
// in "package tofu" it only did static checks of the declarations in each
// module, so this is a _slightly_ more relevant comparison than it might
// initially appear to be. It still saves a lot of time not even trying to
// upgrade, refresh, or plan anything from prior state though. (For this to
// be a really fair comparison it will likely need to end up in a different
// package where it can also run the real planning machinery rather than
// mocking it, because this package does not have the planning engine in its
// scope.)
