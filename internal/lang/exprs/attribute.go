// TODO: We could potentially have two more implementations of [Attribute] here
// which represent object and tuple values (respectively) that can potentially
// be partially-constructed when all of the references include a known
// index step underneath the attribute, but behave like a normal
// [ValueOf] if there's at least one reference that doesn't include a known
// index step. In principle that could be used for multi-instance objects
// like resources to allow instances to refer to each other without it being
// treated as a self-reference.
//
// If the hcl.EvalContext builder has known index steps then it can build
// an object or tuple where any indices not accessed are either not populated
// at all (for an object) or set to [cty.DynamicVal] (for a tuple, where we
// need to populate any "gaps" between the indices being used).
//
// However, there's various other groundwork we'd need to do before we could
// make that work, including but probably not limited to:
// - Have some alternative to hcl.Traversal that can support index steps whose
//   keys are [Valuer] instead of static [cty.Value], so that a reference
//   like aws_instance.example[each.key] can have that each.key evaluated
//   as part of preparing the hcl.EvalContext and we can dynamically decide
//   which individual index to populate to satisfy that reference.
// - Some way to make sure that any marks that would normally be placed on
//   naked aws_instance.example still get applied to the result even when
//   we skip calling the [Valuer] for aws_instance.example as a whole.
//
// As long as we're using [hcl.Traversal] in its current form we would only
// be able to do this partial-building trick when the index key is a constant,
// like in aws_instance.example["foo"], but that's such an unusual situation
// to be not worth the complexity of handling it. It would only be worth it
// if we could support dynamic index keys, so that e.g. a single resource can
// represent a tree by having child nodes refer to the ids of their parents.
