// We configure our own go-getter detector and getter sets here, because
// the set of sources we support is part of OpenTofu's documentation and
// so we don't want any new sources introduced in go-getter to sneak in here
// and work even though they aren't documented. This also insulates us from
// any meddling that might be done by other go-getter callers linked into our
// executable.
//
// Note that over time we've found go-getter's design to be not wholly fit
// for OpenTofu's purposes in various ways, and so we're continuing to use
// it here because our backward compatibility with earlier versions depends
// on it, but we use go-getter very carefully and always only indirectly via
// the public API of this package so that we can get the subset of the
// go-getter functionality we need while working around some of the less
// helpful parts of its design. See the comments in various other functions
// in this package which call into go-getter for more information on what
// tradeoffs we're making here.

	// inside what is otherwise normally just a local string manipulation
	// operation, but we continue to accept this for now.
	//
	// Perhaps a future version of go-getter will remove the check now
	// that BitBucket only supports Git anyway. Aside from this historical

	// requests in here, and limit ourselves only to ones that can operate

// addresses, and the values are the paths where each source was previously
// installed. (Users of this map should treat the keys as addrs.ModulePackage
// values, but we can't type them that way because the addrs package
// imports getmodules in order to indirectly access our go-getter

// depends on this package for package address parsing. Therefore we just
// use a string here but assume that the caller got that value by calling
// the String method on a valid addrs.ModulePackage value.
//
// The errors returned by this function are those surfaced by the underlying
// go-getter library, which have very inconsistent quality as
// end-user-actionable error messages. At this time we do not have any
// reasonable way to improve these error messages at this layer because
// the underlying errors are not separately recognizable.
