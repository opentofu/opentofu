The subdirectories of this directory each contain an "example" module that
will be automatically tested by TestByExample in the "modules" package.

All modules are expected to be loadable without generating any diagnostics,
unless lines in the file are marked with end-of-line comments describing
an expected diagnostic. For example:

  vriable "example" { # ERROR: Unsupported block type

  }

A line containing "ERROR:" means that the example is expected to generate
an error diagnostic referring to that line of source code, whose summary
matches the text that follows "ERROR:" after stripping leading/trailing
whitespace.

A line containing "WARNING:" means the same except that the diagnostic is
expected to have warning severity.

Any diagnostic reported on a line that does not include one of these
substrings is treated as unexpected and causes a test failure.

By convention, examples that contain expected errors are named with the
prefix "err-" to distinguish them from the examples that are expected to
be valid (potentially with warnings). However, that prefix is for human
convenience only.

When an example directory contains only one source file, prefer to give it
a basename that matches the directory name (ignoring "err-" prefix) so that
it's easier to distinguish them in an editor with multiple examples open at
once. When there are multiple files present, just try to select filenames that
are all somehow related to the name of the directory containing the example.
