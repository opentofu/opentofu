// deferredMark is a cty Mark we use to represent that a value is derived from
// something whose planning has been deferred to a later plan/apply round
// for any reason.
//
// We use this to recognize when a resource instance wouldn't need to be
// deferred itself except that its configuration is based on something else that
// was previously deferred, and therefore the downstream must be transitively
// deferred to because whatever outcome it's relying on won't actually happen
// in the current plan/apply round.
//
// Using marks for this means that our analysis of deferrals is based on
// dynamic analysis, so and e.g. a conditional expression where only one arm
// is derived from something deferred will only be treated as deferred if
// that arm were selected.
